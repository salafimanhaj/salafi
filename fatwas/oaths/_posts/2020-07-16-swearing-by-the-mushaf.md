Question: 

In many cases, a man swears by placing his hand on the Mushaf (copy of the Qur'an), is this right or is it enough to swear by Allah only?  

Answer: 

It is enough to swear by Allah without having to put the hand on the Mushaf.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
