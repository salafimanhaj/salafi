Question: 

Is placing henna in the grave with the deceased part of the Islamic ceremony? If yes, what are its benefits?

Answer: 

The Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) indicates that the deceased should be washed with water and extract from the lote tree, and the shrouds should be scented. As for putting henna in the grave, this has no basis in Shari’ah; it should be abandoned.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
